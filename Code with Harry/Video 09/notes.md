# Id and classes

## What is an ID?
- An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page.
- It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.

## What are classes?
- The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
- That way, you can easily change their look and behavior all at once.
- Classea are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements.
- They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviours to a group of elements.
